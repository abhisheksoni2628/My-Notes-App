# My-Notes-App
My Notes app is a Clean Architecture Notes App (MVVM), and we use Room Database.  The Room Database serves as an efficient storage platform for my Notes App, allowing for a highly-structured and organized system.   The Room Database also ensures data safety and security, allowing users to store their notes securely and reliably.
